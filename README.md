This is project to practice my Python programming skills and to get familiar with some import Python modules.

Project schedule:
1. create a HTML data scraping tool to extract currency exchange data between US dollars and Chinese Yuan and date
2. create a program to run the HTML extractor once a day and produce a csv file
3. visualize the csv file data in Python by plot chart
4. send a email to a specific account once currency rate is lower than a specific point
